# HRAP  
## HRIS Analysis Platform  
📺 **Proposal Video:** https://youtu.be/NAzth4Bz-Ag

---

## 🔍 Motivation
In our **Data Mining** course, we used PCA, K-Means, and One-Hot Encoding.  
In **People Analytics**, we practiced analyzing HR data using Excel and MySQL.  
In **Database Systems**, we built applications using Flask with MySQL and MongoDB.

To combine these skills, we created a **web-based HR analysis platform** that turns our academic learning into a practical real-world project.

## ❗ Problem Statement
HR departments often spend large amounts of time manually organizing data.  
These manual processes are slow, error-prone, and make data-driven decisions difficult.
